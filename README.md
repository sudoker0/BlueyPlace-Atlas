# The BlueyPlace Atlas

The BlueyPlace Atlas is an interactive map which is modified from [the 2023 r/Place atlas](https://sudoker0.xyz/BlueyPlace-Atlas/) for the BlueyPlace event on [The Heeler House](https://discord.gg/blueyheeler).

This project is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSE) in respect to the license of the [original project on GitHub](https://github.com/placeAtlas/atlas-2023).

## Contributing
Contribution are welcome, especially since it can hard to keep track and annotate artwork. To contribute, you may follow the guide below, which is modified from the original guide to fit more with this atlas, or read the guide about [how to contribute](https://github.com/placeAtlas/atlas-2023/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#new-atlas-entries) in the original project.

## How to Contribute
To add a new entry, go to [the drawing mode](https://sudoker0.xyz/BlueyPlace-Atlas?mode=draw) and draw a shape/polygon around the region you'd like to describe. You can use the <kbd>Undo</kbd>, <kbd>Redo</kbd>, and <kbd>Reset</kbd> buttons to help you creating a good polygon. Make sure that the lines you're drawing don't form a [self-intersecting polygon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Complex_polygon.svg/288px-Complex_polygon.svg.png).

If you want to see which areas of the canvas do not have entries yet, select "Highlight Empty" to hide areas that already have entries.

When you're happy with the shape you've drawn, press <kbd>Finish</kbd>. You will now be able to enter some information about the entry:

- **Name**: A short, descriptive name.
- **Description**: A short description that can be understood by somebody not familiar with the topic. If you were involved in drawing this artwork, you may include the meta, describing the process of drawing the artwork in the event.
- **Links**: Some links that are most relevant to the topic, and/or regarding the process of the drawing the artwork in the event.
	- **Website**: If you're describing a project, the project's main website would be suitable here.
	- **Subreddit**: Format it like `r/subreddit`.
	- **Discord**: Write the invite code, that the invite link without the `discord.gg/` part.

All fields but the name are optional. For example, a country flag doesn't necessarily need a description.

Once you've entered all the information, you'll be presented with a pop-up window containing some [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)-formatted data. You may wish to submit an Issue or a Pull Request if you know what you're doing, or alternatively, you can message me on [The Heeler House discord server](https://discord.gg/blueyheeler).
